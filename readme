This file contains instructions for proper usage of this program. 

The easiest way to use this program is to import it into a development environment program like Eclipse. 
This will automatically compile the required files before running the file you want. 
 
Otherwise you can compile it from a command line. Then run the file you want to run.


The following files are used to execute the program:
Ringgz: to start a local game.
Client: to connect to a server and play remotely.
Server: to start a host for clients to connect to, although it does not have the intended functionality.


Description of executables and arguments:

Ringgz: None. Change the types of players you want in Ringgz.java.

Client: <name> <address> <port> <human/cpu> <extention1> <extention2> <extention3>
